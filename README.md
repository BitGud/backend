# BitGub - Backend
WDCC x SESA Hackathon 2021 :computer:

**Introduction**
As new developers we identified a problem, and attempt to solve it. We noticed that after sometime, say 10 or 20min, some students have trouble staying focused.  Hence we stated a product goal using an user focused approach:

To create an application that is **useful, effective, enjoyable**, and most importantly that it assists students all the way from beginner to advanced level.
